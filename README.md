# burger-2

In this assignment, you're going to Sequelize the Burger app you made last week. 


Sequelized! 


Remove all references to your vanilla MySQL queries and replace them with Sequelize queries.


Replacing your MySQL Burger model with a Sequelized equivalent.

Don't forget to sync the models!
Edit your new config.json file to include your database configurations. Place your JawsDB details in the production property of your json file; the details of your local database go in the developer property.
Remove your old ORM file, as well as any references to it in burgers_controller.js. Replace those references with Sequelize's ORM methods.
